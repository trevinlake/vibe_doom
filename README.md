# vibe_doom
This is meant to be for fun. It is also an example to illustrate what LLMs can and can't do. The idea behind this project is to create a version of the classic game Doom using only LLMs (vibe coding only), not your own coding skills. Feel free to create your own branch and submit a PR. If I feel like it's better than what is currently in main, I will merge it to main! Let's see what we get!
