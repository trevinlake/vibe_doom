# vibe_doom
This is meant for fun. It is an example of what LLMs can and can't do. The idea behind this project is to create a version of the classic game Doom using only LLMs (vibe coding only), not your own coding skills. Feel free to create your own branch and submit a PR if I feel like it's better I will merge it to main! Let's see what we get!
